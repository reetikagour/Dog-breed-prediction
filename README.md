# Dog-breed-prediction
Predicts breed of the dog by taking the dog image as input.

I have taken the dataset for predicting the breed of the dog from kaggle.
**Dataset** - https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

Built a classifier using Resnet50 CNN architecture which is trained only on 10 breeds. It could be performed on whole dataset as well.
This repossitory contains ipynb file in which model got trained and all the performance matrices are calculated on test data.

Other files are used for creating a web API using flask.
